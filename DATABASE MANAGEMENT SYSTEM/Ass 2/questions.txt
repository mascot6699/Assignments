Database Details:

 

Use the following GARDEN database to answer all questions in the exam.

Some notes on the terms used:

 

- The database is for a simple garden kept by a small family. They plant their garden in the spring and pick their garden in summer.

- The sunlight attribute refers to the percentage of a 24 hour day that the location gets sunlight and the plant optimally wants sunlight.

- The water attribute refers to the percentage of average rainfall that makes it to the root level for a location or is optimal for a plant.

- The plant (average expected) and picked (actual) weight is in kilograms

- The picked amount is the number of items (one carrot, one beet, an ear of corn, one tomato, one radish) picked.

The queries to create the tables and the data to be inserted are listed below: Run these queries against the database to have your tables and data ready.

Script to be run to set up the tables and insert the respective data:

Create table Location (locationid number primary key, name varchar2(30), sunlight number, water number);

Create table Gardener (gardenerid number primary key, name varchar2(30), age number);

Create table Plant (plantid number primary key, name varchar2(30), sunlight number, water number, weight number);

Create table planted (plantFK number, gardenerFK number, locationFK number, date1 date, seeds number, foreign key(plantFK) references plant(plantid), foreign key(gardenerFK) references gardener(gardenerid), foreign key(locationFK) references location(locationid));

Create table picked (plantFK number, gardenerFK number, locationFK number, date1 date, amount number, weight number, foreign key(plantFK) references plant(plantid), foreign key(gardenerFK) references gardener(gardenerid), foreign key(locationFK) references location(locationid));

  

Insert into location values(0, ‘East’, .28, .80);

Insert into location values(1, ‘North’, .17, .84);

Insert into location values(2, ‘West’, .38, .48);

Insert into location values(3, ‘South’, .45, .66);

 

Insert into gardener values(0, ‘Mother’, 36);

Insert into gardener values(1, ‘Father’, 38);

Insert into gardener values(2, ‘Tim’, 15);

Insert into gardener values(3, ‘Erin’, 12);

 

Insert into plant values(0, ‘Carrot’, .26, .82, .08);

Insert into plant values(1, ‘Beet’, .44, .80, .04);

Insert into plant values(2, ‘Corn’, .44, .76, .26);

Insert into plant values(3, ‘Tomato’, .42, .80, .16);

Insert into plant values(4, ‘Radish’, .28, .84, .02);

Insert into plant values(5, ‘Lettuce’, .29, .85, .03);

 

 

Insert into planted values(0, 0, 0 , ‘18-APR-2012’, 28);

Insert into planted values(0, 1, 1 , ‘14-APR-2012’, 14);

Insert into planted values(1, 0, 2 , ‘18-APR-2012’, 36);

Insert into planted values(2, 1, 3 , ‘14-APR-2012’, 20);

Insert into planted values(2, 2, 2 , ‘19-APR-2012’, 12);

Insert into planted values(3, 3, 3 , ‘25-APR-2012’, 38);

Insert into planted values(4, 2, 0 , ‘30-APR-2012’, 30);

Insert into planted values(5, 2, 0 , ‘15-APR-2012’, 30);

 

 

Insert into picked values(0, 2, 0 , ‘18-AUG-2012’, 28, 2.32);

Insert into picked values(0, 3, 1 , ‘16-AUG-2012’, 12, 1.02);

Insert into picked values(2, 1, 3 , ‘22-AUG-2012’, 52, 12.96);

Insert into picked values(2, 2, 2 , ‘28-AUG-2012’, 18, 4.58);

Insert into picked values(3, 3, 3 , ‘22-AUG-2012’, 15, 3.84);

Insert into picked values(4, 2, 0 , ‘16-JUL-2012’, 23, 0.52);

 

 

After the database tables and data are set; write the following queries

 
 

1

Write a valid SQL statement that calculates the total weight of all corn cobs that were picked from the garden:

 

2

For some reason Erin has change his location for picking the tomato to North. Write the corresponding query.

 

3

Insert a new column Exper of type Number (30) to the ‘gardener’ table which stores  Experience of the of person. How will you modify this to varchar(30).

 

4

Write a query to find the plant name which required seeds less than 20 which plant on 14-APR

 

5

List the amount of sunlight and water to all plants with names that start with letter  ‘c’ or letter ‘r’.

 

6

Write a valid SQL statement that displays the plant name and  the total amount of seed required for each plant that were plant in the garden. The output should be in descending order of plant name.

 

7

Write a valid SQL statement that calculates the average number of items produced per seed planted for each plant type:( (Average number of items = total amount picked / total seeds planted.)

 

8

Write a valid SQL statement that would produce a result set like the

    following:

 

                name |  name  |    date    | amount

               ------+--------+------------+--------

                Tim  | Radish | 2012-07-16 |     23

                Tim  | Carrot | 2012-08-18 |     28

              

9

Find out persons who picked from the same location as he/she planted.

 

10

Create a view that lists all the plant names picked from all locations except ’West’ in the month of August.
