Write a c-program for simulation of  Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) CPU scheduler.

Program should maintain Ready_Q using process pointers. Each Process should have cpu_time and arrival_time . Cpu_time and arrival_time should be generated randomly. Demonstrate processes context switch according to SRTF Scheduling.

Struct process

{

Int pid;

Int cpu_time;

Int arrival_time;

Struct process * next;

}

 

Void main()

{

Initialize

/*

Generate n no of process.

Assign process_id serially to each process.

Randomly generate cpu_time and arrival_time for each process.

Create & initialize Ready_Q with n no of processes.

 

   */

Untill Ready_Q <> empy

{

select Queue Ready_Q

Randomly generate current_time requirement out of total_time requirement for corresponding process present on the front of corresponding queue.

Call delay for current_time no of times.

Subtract current_time from total_cpu_time & update total_cpu_time

Shift process to another queue.

displyQueue.
