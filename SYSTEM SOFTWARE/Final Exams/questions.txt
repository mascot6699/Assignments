1) Make a program for left factoring of the productions

Left Factoring

Left factoring is a grammar transformation that is useful producing a grammar suitable for predictive parsing. The basic idea is that when it is not clear which of two alternative productions to use to expand a non terminal A, we may rewrite the A-productions to defer the decision until we have seen enough of the input to make the right choice. 
If A==>ab1|ab2 are two A-productions and the input begins with a non empty string derived from a , we do not know whether to expand A to ab1 or to ab2.
We may defer decision by expanding A to aA' . Then after seeing the input derived from a we expand A' to b1 or to b2
A==>aA'
A'==>b1|b2
